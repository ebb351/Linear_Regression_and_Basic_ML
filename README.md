# Machine Learning Coursework

This repository contains a collection of programming labs from the **Machine Learning** course (CS-GY 6923) taught by **Professor Christopher Musco** at **NYU Tandon School of Engineering**. The assignments aim to deepen understanding of fundamental machine learning methods by building models from scratch, rather than relying on built-in libraries.

## Overview
The labs cover a range of topics and techniques, including:
- **Linear Regression**: Implementation using the closed-form solution, evaluation with different loss functions (L2, L1, and Linfinity), and comparison of solutions obtained through brute force vs. closed-form methods.
- **Time-Series Modeling**: Developing models to analyze and predict neural data, using techniques like delay optimization and cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
- **Text Generation and NLP**: Constructing and training autoregressive models for text generation from scratch, demonstrating the quality vs. complexity trade-offs.
- **Logistic Regression for Medical Data**: Implementing logistic regression using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to predict whether cells are benign or malignant. This lab involves data visualization, model fitting, and performance evaluation for binary classification, including precision and recall analysis.
- **Piecewise Linear Regression**: Using the Auto MPG dataset, this lab explores piecewise linear regression modeling with different segments of data, fitting slopes, and intercepts based on breakpoints. It also involves evaluating the model's performance using L2 loss and visualizing the fitted model.
- **Gradient Descent Optimization**: Building a simple gradient descent optimizer from scratch, implementing regularization, stochastic gradient descent, and adaptive learning rates to explore their effects on convergence and model performance.

## Coursework Highlights
- **Hands-On Implementation**: Each lab focuses on building models and algorithms from the ground up, showcasing a strong understanding of ML concepts beyond the use of pre-built packages like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`.
- **Guided but Independent Work**: While these assignments come with high-level guidance, nearly all the code and implementation details were developed independently, following the outlined objectives for each component.
- **Foundational Techniques**: The coursework includes a variety of fundamental techniques, such as fitting regression models, exploring different loss functions, model complexity and selection, logistic regression, time-series analysis, and binary classificationâ€”all essential skills for machine learning roles.

## Why This Repository Stands Out
- **Depth of Understanding**: This repository demonstrates not only my programming abilities but also my deep understanding of machine learning algorithms, gained through direct implementation and experimentation.
- **Well-Documented Code**: Each notebook includes detailed explanations and visualizations that illustrate the purpose and methodology behind every step, making the concepts accessible and easy to understand.
- **Practical Applications**: The labs provide practical, real-world examples that showcase my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real datasets, an essential skill for any machine learning role.
